                            <p>Know that refunds are indeed possible in certain situations where a job doesn&#39;t proceed as planned due to delays.
                                However, the specific circumstances would need to be discussed and agreed upon by both the service provider and the
                                client.
                                If the service provider has already purchased materials, it&#39;s likely that they would need to discuss a refund or a modified
                                agreement with the client to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This is a great opportunity for both parties to
                                communicate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
                                We&#39;ll make sure to update you and the service provider once we receive an update on the agreement reached between
                                them. Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we&#39;re always here to help facilitate a smooth and successful transaction!</p>
